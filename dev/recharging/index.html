<ul>
<li>Don't overlook checking in with other engineers</li>
<li>Don't overlook checking in with yourself and ensuring you are getting needed recharges</li>
</ul>
<p>One of my managers emphasized balancing growing the team (long term success)
and delivering (short term success).  With one particular project, we planned
out what was needed to help the junior engineers grow.  To support them in
this, I took on some of the grunt work.  At one point, my plate was clear, so I
thought &quot;I'll lay the groundwork for this other engineer&quot;.  I hadn't noticed
how drained I was and how addicting the recharge was from this bit of
greenfield development.  I quickly completed the project.  Unfortunately, the
other engineer was mad.  That was the one piece of work they were most looking
forward to.</p>
