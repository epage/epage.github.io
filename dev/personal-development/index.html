			<p>Whether it was school, side readings, or coworkers, I was soaking up everything
I could at the beginning of my career.  Out of college, I used this background
to help convince a very senior team to change some of our practices.</p>
<p>As I grew in respect / seniority, I was reviewing the work of other engineers
more.  I had gut feelings and vague descriptions of &quot;beauty&quot; and &quot;ugly&quot; to
describe to others what I was wanting to see from their code.  This was
frustrating to the people I was reviewing and they were wanting to brush off my
feedback because it wasn't concrete.</p>
<p>My problem was that I learned all of this for myself but I didn't consider how
to capture it for me to teach others (mentoring hadn't even crossed my mind in
college).  Enough time had passed before teaching became important, that I had
developed an intuition for applying what I learned remembering the language for
it, the way to describe the motivation to help explain it to others.</p>
