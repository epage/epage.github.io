[clap](https://docs.rs/clap/4.2.0/clap/) v4.2.0 is now out with styling of
help descriptions!  See the
[changelog](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more
details.

## What Changed in v4.2.0

### User Styling of Help Descriptions

By default, clap will style the output of `--help` but there wasn't a way for
users to do the same, whether to emphasize something or for a custom section,
like "Examples".

As
[previously discussed](https://epage.github.io/blog/2023/03/anstream-simplifying-terminal-styling/),
we settled on using ANSI escape codes for this so you can use the library of
your choice.  For example, with the
[color-print](https://crates.io/crates/color-print) crate, you can now do:
```rust
// `cstr!` converts tags to ANSI codes
let after_help: &'static str = color_print::cstr!(
r#"<bold><underline>Examples</underline></bold>

  <dim>$</dim> <bold>mybin --input file.toml</bold>
"#);

let cmd = clap::Command::new("mybin")
    .after_help(after_help)  // The `&str` gets converted into a `StyledStr`
    // ...
```

To know if ANSI escape codes will be handled properly, look for builder methods that accept 
[`StyledStr`](https://docs.rs/clap/4.2.0/clap/builder/struct.StyledStr.html).

### Further Error Tweaks

In clap v4.1, we
[changed error messages](https://epage.github.io/blog/2023/01/clap-v4-1/).
This release further iterates on them based on
[feedback we received](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/4638).

clap v4.0:
```
error: Found argument '--optio' which wasn't expected, or isn't valid in this context

  Did you mean '--option'?

Usage: clap-test --option <opt>... [positional] [positional2] [positional3]...

For more information try '--help'
```

clap v4.1:
```
error: unexpected argument '--optio'

  note: argument '--option' exists

Usage: clap-test --option <opt>... [positional] [positional2] [positional3]...

For more information, try '--help'.
```

clap v4.2:
```
error: unexpected argument '--optio'

  tip: a similar argument exists: '--option'

Usage: clap-test --option <opt>... [positional] [positional2] [positional3]...

For more information, try '--help'.
```

I'm sure there is room for improvement.  We welcome further discussion
on this on
[#4638](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/4638).

### Removed `unstable-replace`

We've had
[`Command::replace`](https://docs.rs/clap/4.1.3/clap/builder/struct.Command.html#method.replace)
behind the `unstable-replace` feature flag since 3.0.0 but there has been little
interest expressed in it and the design doesn't align well with the rest of
clap, so we've removed it.

As alternatives
- For commands that are meant to expand to nested subcommands, we recommend
  just creating a `Command` for it and having it reuse the relevant args and
  help.
- For args implying other args, we hope to solve this with [#4793](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/4793).

If you have any feedback on this decision, we welcome it at [#2836](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/2836).

## What Changed in v4.1.x

While minor releases get a lot more attention, there is still a lot of
interesting work done in patch releases that deserve being highlighted.

### Build Times

We've seen several different build-time improvements including
- Speed up of the `arg!` macro
- Split out a `clap_builder` crate to parallelize its build with `clap_derive`
  - Builder users should not notice the difference because the `clap` facade
    gets built in parallel to `clap_builder`s code-gen
- Removed some dependencies including `proc-macro-error` (derive-specific)

For very unscientific numbers:

|     | v4.1.0 | v4.2.0 |
|-----|--------|--------|
| `clap $ cargo build` | 4.250s | 3.923s |
| `clap $ cargo build -F derive` | 6.419s | 4.602s |

For more numbers, see [argparse-rosetta-rs](https://github.com/rosetta-rs/argparse-rosetta-rs).

### Deriving `ArgGroup`

In clap v4.0.0, we automatically generate an
[`ArgGroup`](https://docs.rs/clap/4.2.0/clap/struct.ArgGroup.html) for each
derived `Args` but there was no way to customize the `ArgGroup`, requiring
people to still manually create them in some cases:
```rust
#[derive(Parser)]
#[command(group(
            ArgGroup::new("vers")
                .required(true)
                .args(["set_ver", "major", "minor", "patch"]),
        ))]
struct Cli {
    /// set version manually
    #[arg(long, value_name = "VER")]
    set_ver: Option<String>,

    /// auto inc major
    #[arg(long)]
    major: bool,

    /// auto inc minor
    #[arg(long)]
    minor: bool,

    /// auto inc patch
    #[arg(long)]
    patch: bool,

    /// some regular input
    #[arg(group = "input")]
    input_file: Option<String>,
}
```

We now support `#[group]`
[raw attributes](https://docs.rs/clap/4.2.0/clap/_derive/index.html#terminology),
allowing
[any `ArgGroup` builder method](https://docs.rs/clap/4.2.0/clap/struct.ArgGroup.html)
to be used:
```rust
#[derive(Parser)]
#[command(author, version, about, long_about = None)]
struct Cli {
    #[command(flatten)]
    vers: Vers,

    /// some regular input
    #[arg(group = "input")]
    input_file: Option<String>,
}

#[derive(Args)]
#[group(required = true, multiple = false)]
struct Vers {
    /// set version manually
    #[arg(long, value_name = "VER")]
    set_ver: Option<String>,

    /// auto inc major
    #[arg(long)]
    major: bool,

    /// auto inc minor
    #[arg(long)]
    minor: bool,

    /// auto inc patch
    #[arg(long)]
    patch: bool,
}
```

Granted, the above would be better expressed as an `enum` which we are tracking
in [#2621](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/2621).
