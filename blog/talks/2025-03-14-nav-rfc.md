## Lessons I've learned

.image-middle[![I've authored 12 RFCs]({{site.base_url}}/talks/nav-rfc-my-rfcs.png)]

???

Some times RFCs can be rough.
I wouldn't be surprised if people felt if RFCs were a punishment for having a good idea.
In particular, the RFC for naming `usize` was handled poorly.
Another major rough patch was the module system for the 2018 Edition.

I'm pulling this from lessons I've learned in authoring RFCs

The Rust Project has been experimenting with decision making processes on the team level

But this leaves the question of what these are, which to use, or even where to find these.

Knowing about MCPs, participated in them, and even authored some, I had a hard time finding the documentation for them.

.left-column[
MCP

???

So what is an MCP?

Well, its a term specific to the compiler team and a general idea with different takes by each team.

For example, the API team calls it an "API Change Proposal" while cargo doesn't have anything so formal and we use issues.

So what sets apart an MCP from an RFC?

How do I know which one to use?

‘2-Way Door’: reversible decisions, we make a call, and it’s relatively easy to change it if we discover it’s not working out as we’d hoped. 

‘1-Way Door‘: irreversible decisions, once we’re in, we’re not coming back out. From Jeff B: “These decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don't like what you see on the other side, you can't get back to where you were before.”

But the line isn't always clear-cut.
- Editions can't undo 1-way doors but can reduce the impact.
- Shifting the community's momentum takes work and we don't want to be yanking them around.
- A refactoring might seem like a 2-way door but the cost to pull it out 6 months down the line might be high.

MCP examples:
- major refactorings
- changes to important types
- important changes to how the compiler does something
- smaller user-facing changes

So how do I know which to use?

Members of the relevant team can help but we are skipping a step.

Or or past discussions.

If someone else is already running with it, great! Now you are my other target audience

If it has been discussed but stalled out, the first thing to do is to understand all of the previous discussion and summarize it back.
This will help you understand the nuance with the idea and help the team members catch up on this specific topic which makes it more likely they'll participate.
Then find a way to navigate concerns raised and present this back.

If nothing, then Internals tends to be a great place to get a vibe check on your idea and to better flesh it out.
You may even formalize this into what we call a Pre-RFC

Whether on Internals or the RFC, you are likely to run into a lot of feedback

You can easily be pulled in many different directions.

Balance feedback through our values!

For the MSRV resolver RFC,
while some people did not get their way,
listening to everyone's input and digging into their underlying concerns was critical for coming to the final design of the RFC.

**Author:** you have a say!

**Community:** valuable input

**Project Team:** decision makers

Knowing that ultimately it is the team that must sign off without dissent helps focus how you deal with these.

Even within a team you can have conflicting opinions but that is a smaller group to focus on.

This doesn't mean you ignore the community!

The more people involved in the decision, the harder it is, especially when it crosses teams as that means you have two autonomous groups meeting individually, throwing their thoughts over the wall at each other.

Look for ways to scale down an RFC to an MVP that only involves one team.
For example, the `supported-targets` RFC might have involved crates.io but that part got deferred.

.right[*Source: paraphrasing Josh Triplett paraphrasing me*]

???

I said this about PRs and then Josh applied to RFCs.
Like PRs, if you put too much into an RFC, it can make the discussion take longer because people tend to be distracted by what is currently the biggest "problem"

Sometimes that means that some "problems" never get proper consideration.

All unresolved questions will need to be addressed before being approved.

Once the RFC is approved, it is final.

???

As a new Cargo team member mentoring a new contributor,
it was daunting to say that we should throw out parts of an RFC written by Alex.

Whats important is that we communicate them to the responsible team when stabilizing.

However, deferring decisions or changing decisions only works when the problem is niche, not requiring full community input.

As we've discussed, its easy to get overwhelmed with long discussions.

If the author has been summarizing resolved conversations within the RFC, that helps.

.center[![A threaded conversation]({{site.base_url}}/talks/nav-rfc-threads.png)]

My tip? never post on the main thread.  Find the most relevant part of the RFC and post there.
- The main thread can be hard to follow
- Maybe someone else with the same idea thought to post in the same spot and you will find their comment 

Hopefully the author is also working to consolidate threads, including taking things off the main thread.

Ideally an RFC author eventually replies with how your feedback was integrated so you can see how well it was captured

---

How do I jump in?

- Humility, in order to genuinely question the instinct that your values, ideas and opinions are the Right Ones.
- Empathy, in order to genuinely “put on” someone else’s perspective, needs and values as if they were your own.
- Introspection, in order to reach a deeper understanding of your own impulses and values.

It can be easy to forget there are care abouts beyond your own, when authoring or reviewing a PR.
We need people to look at the bigger picture across concerns and understand that at times,
two competent people can come to different conclusions and accept it

Items I may have not covered:
- "why don't you just"
- values
- be cautious of momentum, fatigue, etg
