        <p>I've been involved in the Rust community for about a year and a half now.  What
attracted me to Rust is that is looks like the first viable replacement for
C++.  It offers similar (actually better) protections than GCed languages and
the full language is available in any environment, including exception-like
error handling in the Windows kernel.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>1aim partially sponsored my attendance at RustFest.  At the start of the year,
the Rust community organized working groups for targeted improvements to the
language for <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/announcing-the-2018-domain-working-groups/6737">several use
cases</a>.
1aim was looking for working group members to sponsor and the WG-CLI leader
sponsored me due to my involvement with the working group where I've been
working to make my life easier for my maintaining my tools.</p>
<p>Sadly, I'm writing this up so late from the main event (the talks), that I'm
not going into as much detail as I'd like.</p>
<h3>Talks (Saturday)</h3>
<p>The opening Keynote was on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23lRkdDXqY0&amp;index=1&amp;list=PL85XCvVPmGQgdqz9kz6qH3SI_hp7Zb4s1">Feynman Method for
learning</a>.
Really enjoyed this.  Probably the most memorable part is dealing with jargon.
I've heard before that Elon Musk has a ban on acronyms and proprietary jargon</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Don't use acronyms or nonsense words for objects, software, or processes at
Tesla. In general, anything that requires an explanation inhibits
communication. We don't want people to have to memorize a glossary just to
function at Tesla.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Feynman articulately calls out the real problem with jargon in this quote that
Vaidehi Joshi shares:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we speak without jargon, it frees us from hiding behind knowledge we
don't have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next was a talk on a Rust implementation of TLS / SSL.  Key parts of this talk</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHMRFZkXq4Y&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;list=PL85XCvVPmGQgdqz9kz6qH3SI_hp7Zb4s1&amp;t=1250">Leveraging the type system to avoid GOTO FAIL</a>
<ul>
<li>While the focus is on Rust, languages with weaker type systems can
still get some benefit from these practices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Apparently, there is a OpenSSL wrapper around rustls.  OpenSSL is a big
problem for making &quot;portable&quot; pythons for Linux for nibuild.  I wonder if
we can leverage this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Later was a talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMJEPWcSD8w&amp;list=PL85XCvVPmGQgdqz9kz6qH3SI_hp7Zb4s1&amp;index=8">writing reliable systems</a>.  Highlights</p>
<ul>
<li>Calls out challenges we have in manually identifying corners that need testing.
<ul>
<li>Pesticide paradox: code becomes immune to tests</li>
<li>Besides being good in general, provides good reason to be using property-based testing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good to see more background on property-based testing</li>
<li>Model testing seems intriguing for complex driver interactions at my work.
<ul>
<li>It randomly generates ops to perform on your code.  If it comes across a failure case, it will randomly drop ops to find the minimal reproducible situation.</li>
<li>There was talk of linearizibility.  I don't remember the details on this but had a note that it could help with testing some of our concurrent code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEYqpcQ6lg&amp;list=PL85XCvVPmGQgdqz9kz6qH3SI_hp7Zb4s1&amp;index=11">Monotron
talk</a>
is a great showcase at the potential for Rust for firmware.</p>
<p>Misc talk notes</p>

</ul>
<h3>Workshops (Sunday)</h3>
<p>I skipped the workshops.</p>
<h3>Impl Days (Monday, Tuesday)</h3>
<p>This was a two day hack fest.  I liked this better than the PyCon one.  I'm
unsure if its because I'm more involved in the community or they handle it
better with</p>
<ul>
<li>Clearer mentorship model</li>
<li>Use-case driven cross-ecosystem initiatives making it easier for people to
find problems relevant to them which makes them more invested.</li>
</ul>
<p>I worked on one of my WG-CLI projects, CLI testing.  The crates (packages) provide</p>
<ul>
<li>ability to find and launch you executable</li>
<li>run asserts on the result of your executable</li>
<li>filesystem fixtures</li>
<li>filesystem assertions</li>
</ul>
<h3>Visiting Paris (Thursday, Wednesday)</h3>
<p>This was my first time to Paris.</p>
<p>Misc notes</p>
<ul>
<li>Went on the Arc de'Triomphe</li>
<li>Enjoyed a walked along the Seine River</li>
<li>Visited <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/SOus5YTJySi0JSSO2">Pere Lachaise cemetery</a></li>
<li>While nothing to special about duck or escargot, the sauces they came in were great!</li>
<li>The city is dirty</li>
<li>Everything felt one or two turns away.  I'm unsure if this was because of where my hotel was or all the weird angles all the streets are in.</li>
<li>Every mode of transport is used (train, subway, car, motorcycle, bicycle, scooter, electric scooter, those one wheeled segways) and the roads / sidewalks are chaos.  Anyone who could was scooting around stopped cars in traffic.</li>
<li>Experienced the stereotype of french customer service
<ul>
<li>Got the ire of a bar tender for being the sober person in a group</li>
<li>Despite my flight being empty (as I found out later), they enforced
unusual baggage restrictions.  After waiting in line a while for
checking my carry on, all of the Air France staff disappeared (I flew
KLM to Paris).  Eventually they came back and I was served.  The
gentleman got very frustrated and deposited me in another line without
telling me why I was in the wrong line.  The gatekeeper of this new
line kept telling me I was in the wrong line and needed to go back.
Thankfully ignoring him was the right thing to do.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Should have brought a better umbrella.  It rained nearly every day and now my passport is messed up.  The Air France guy sure made his thoughts on my passport known.</li>
</ul>
