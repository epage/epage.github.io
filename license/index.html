</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">    wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     the licensor&#39;s permission is not necessary for any reason--for
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section

</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">               Material.

</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You

</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">          Rights, but not otherwise.
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">          Public License.
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">          reserves any right to collect such royalties.

</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and

</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
</span><span style="color:#c0c5ce;">     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
